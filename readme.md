#I made a whiteboard!

##A cool thingy
It uses webRTC (I think?) to keep you and your friends connected while you draw. Current version makes random colors for you and your friends, and off you go drawing with eachother!! (As long as you're both on the same network):D !!!

##Console Commands 
* colorPicker(num)
	* Assign a random color (if no parameter) or one of six set colors if given input
* userColor='hex'
	* Takes hex input and changes your color to that
* diam(num)
	* Takes a number and sets that to the diameter of your circle in pixels
* erase()
	* erase every connection's screen of all the drawn dots
